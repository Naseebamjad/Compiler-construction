# Course: CS-471L Compiler Construction
This repository contains the compiler developed as part of the CS-471L Compiler Construction Lab, taught by Mr. Laeeq Uz Zaman Khan Niazi at the Department of Computer Science, University of Engineering & Technology, Lahore, Pakistan. The compiler is implemented using C++ and covers all fundamental phases of compiler construction.

# Overview
The project encompasses the following phases of compiler construction:

# Lexical Analysis (Scanner)

Tokenizes the input source code into meaningful symbols.
# Syntax Analysis (Parser)

Constructs a syntax tree from tokens.
# Semantic Analysis

Performs type checking and enforces language semantics.
Intermediate Code Generation

Translates syntax trees into intermediate code.
# Code Optimization

Enhances intermediate code for performance improvements.
# Code Generation

Converts optimized intermediate code into target machine code.
Error Handling and Recovery

Detects and reports syntactic and semantic errors.
